# Ouroboros: The Eternal Cycle

The [ouroboros](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ouroboros), a serpent eating its own tail, is a symbol present in many different cultures and religious beliefs.  It symbolizes the interconnectedness of everything and the eternality of time, space, and existence.  

When we were first introduced to this project and discussed the concept of time, my mind went to two places: The Twilight Zone (“Time Enough at Last” - it gets me every time) and The X Files (“Never Again” - a man with a pin-up girl tattoo that speaks to him convinces Scully to get a tattoo of the Ouroboros).

Our readings about time, the history of human perceptions and recordings of it, and artistic renditions of time made me consider a couple of iterations of clock designs:

THE FLOWER CLOCK
(I love flowers and flower language and this concept really connected with me)
1. representing Linnaeus’ flower clock with a blooming circle of flowers, and a message about flowers being closed from 2-3 am (if I were to follow this clock suggestion from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/garden/planting-a-clock-that-tracks-hours-by-flowers.html))
2. representing Linnaeus’ flower clock with a written poem or flowery statement that would change color scheme based upon the time of day, print the name of the flower in bloom, and include a picture/gif of that particular flower

THE VIDEO GAME ACHIEVEMENT CLOCK (inspired largely from the translating time into the width of a rectangle example and a desire to make it “interesting,” plus the idea of it being an achievement to make it through the day)
1. three bars (representing health, mana, and stamina) and RPG-style awards given after each minute and hour passed
2. a college student-themed bar setup that would print encouragements and achievements for passing minutes and hours based upon the time of day; would reset at the end of each day (high score reached and then immediately reset)

For some reason, I kept thinking about the Ouroboros.  Perhaps it was me thinking about how such a simple representation could invoke such powerful premises, or even because I just really like The X Files and mythology.  I guess you could say that I got wrapped up in the idea…

Circles are often used to represent the passing of time, and in Western thought, time is seen, to a certain extent, as continuous (time flowing) AND discrete (looking back to a certain time).  I think that we insist on dividing it into units of hours, minutes, and seconds because we want to feel like we have control over time, when in actuality, time flows without the help of human beings.  We don’t wind the clock, the clock winds us.

My simple clock made in p5.js creates a graphical representation of the current time in a novel, abstract way - it represents time as it passes, but doesn’t do much in the way of telling the exact time at any given moment.  Using ouroboros symbolism in a clock design continues on themes present in “typical” clock designs with a provocative twist.  I use three concentric ouroboros to represent the passage of seconds, minutes, and hours, starting with the innermost symbol and moving outward.  The familiar circular motif of the snakes gives off the impression that this is an ordinary Western clock face, with snake faces as showing time like the hands of a clock.  Instead, this clock portrays the passage of time but does not display the time at any given moment.  This conceptualization of time emphasizes its cyclic, continuous nature, satisfying Western minds imperfectly as familiar imagery is morphed to incorporate ancient beliefs.  With this provocative clock, I argue that it doesn’t matter what exact time it is if your existence marches steadily along.  The easiest way to see this clock in action is to copy the contents of [the javascript file](concentric-clock.js)  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

I consulted Zach Whalen’s coding examples and reviewed several different p5.js reference pages.  You can find the urls to these commented in my code, showing where I used each snippet or sought assistance.

The ouroboros image that I chose came from Wikimedia Commons and is labelled for reuse - you can find a link to the image commented in my code.  I added color to the snakes using GIMP, choosing brown-gold hues to imitate jewelry designs that include ouroboros symbolism.  A purple background went nicely with the golden browns; both color choices were seconded by Sandra.  I decided to color the snakes with an ombre feel to create additional ambience.

In the future, I’d like to try to build a flower clock and a video-game-achievement-themed clock.  For now, the eternal snake will tick into eternity.
