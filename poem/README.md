# Death In The Pot

When we began this project, my first thought was to compile a bunch of ingredients lists (mainly food packaging, but possibly some from other products) and create poetry with them by specifying a structure and then using word replacement to make them “readable.”  I have been (playfully) accused of having a food theme, and I may (seriously) continue this.

In exploring the Project Gutenberg repository, I immediately scrolled through the Technology Bookshelf and my eye caught on “A Treatise on Adulterations of Food, and Culinary Poisons” by Frederick Accum in 1820.  This book talks about commonly contaminated food items and how to distinguish if food or drink has been tampered with or is unsafe to consume.  In 1800s London, this book would have been particularly useful.  Skimming through this book made me think about MGMT’s Little Dark Age, and about my poison jewelry, and decided to come up with a “Gothicky” scheme for poetry that would imitate someone slowly but surely dying of poison. The title “Death In The Pot” comes from a scripture passage quoted early in the work.

The final version of my code does this…

I’m envisioning a poem like this one typed here, where
it goes on at length for a little bit,
going on and on and on but then
slowly but surely stops going on and
on and on, starting to disappear
from the page, faintly beginning
to diminish until perhaps,
just maybe, it
is no
more.

…and earlier versions of my code did this…

Right now, it’s doing this thing where it gradually disappears.
Right now, it’s doing this thing where it gradually 
Right now, it’s doing this thing where it 
Right now, it’s doing this thing where 
Right now, it’s doing this thing 
Right now, it’s doing this 
Right now, it’s doing 
Right now, it’s
Right now, 
Right

…both of which are potentially interesting poetically.  The first sounds like someone slowly trailing off into oblivion, while the second sounds like someone stuttering confusedly, losing their train of thought over and over until there is no more track to run on.  I chose 10 lines of poetry for each because it sounds like a countdown - 10…9…8…7…

Other code commented in my .py file randomizes each descending line as the computer chooses lines of desired length in different places of the text.  I’d like to envision that demise as one eating a bad piece of food which causes them to lose their sanity completely as they slowly succumb to the contamination.

My code generates poetry because it takes a text that reads like a textbook and uses a formatting schema to add a new dimension to its meaning.  No matter which of the formats you input culinarypoisons.txt into, the computer generates what may be imagined as a human narrator slowly disappearing.


(Reading this back, everything sounds pretty macabre.)
