# Wake Me Up

This "screensaver" design was born out of my frustration of not being able to implement earlier designs, including a melting screenshot background and a gradually-bricked-in-wall with a face bursting through/behind it.  I have included the pieces of code that I attempted as comments at the bottom of my txt file.

With this screen saver, I wanted to portray a sense of urgency.  Using some of the lyrics from an Evanescence (meme) song called “Wake Me Up Inside”, I want to visually display different levels of desperation - for the user to wake up the computer￼￼ as its “vision” is more and more inhibited (if this screensaver were playing on a laptop or desktop) and for the helplessness of the viewers who cannot do anything to stop its eventual disappearance (particularly for the HCC as bricks with no stroke slowly consume the image and make it blend into the physical wall).

I included a background image of an eye to increase the metaphor of “vision” (the HCC will have a giant eye now…is it a cyclops?), and the images of the head covered in eyeballs is a photograph I took of a collage that I did with magazine clippings on a styrofoam head.  It’s Argus, Hera’s servant in Greek mythology, who had eyes all over his body and was an effective guard because he would only let half of his eyes sleep at a time…until he was lulled to sleep with music.  I find it appropriate that I have musical lyrics about desiring “awake-ness” juxtaposed with Argus and a giant eye that are all being gradually covered by generic beige-gray.

Additionally, the idea of “waking up” in the context of screensavers is ironic - the purpose of a screensaver is to preserve a screen state, and this screensaver does its job but at the same time encourages one to get back to work on computer-related tasks, effectively relieving it of its duties and rendering it obsolete.

The haphazard arrangement is purposeful - I am trying to harken to “shitpost” memes that use word art and psychedelic backgrounds, along with 1980s family portraits that involve two images of the same person but facing different directions or in different sizes and transparencies.

…I think midterms week is making me feel particularly pessimistic, and my design does seem to express this the more that I reflect on its potential interpretations.  I’m feeling the stress for sure.  I hope that this screensaver doesn’t stress people out.

I definitely want to revisit the ideas that I was unable to implement in time for this project, I need to keep watching videos and looking through tutorials so that I can learn and understand the skills and functions I need to create something more advanced.
